# ESP32Clock
ESP32 clock which uses an ESP32 with OLED board and synch over the network

## Introduction
I looked for something interesting to create with my ESP32 board with OLED display, so I decided to create this application to practice on this board.

## Changelog
A changelog is provided to track major and minor changes to the project

## Instructions
This sketch requires a little configuration for WiFi and NTP. All configuration is required to be contained in a file called WiFiData.h placed nearby the ESP32Clock.ino file.
A sample file is provided (WiFiData-template.h) which can be copied and modified with the required data.
